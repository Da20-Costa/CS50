sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Using the best scenario (the list already sorted - 50000), it took 1.181s to sort it, which is pretty fast. However, in the worst scenario (the reversed list - 50000),it took 5.718s to sort it. Comparing the two running times, they correspond to the bounds of the bubble sort, which are quite distants from each other: O(n²) and Ω(n).

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Using the same method as before, when we compare the two running times (best: 1.583s; worst: 1.193s), they are quite similar, besides being pretty fast. Analyzing the asymptotic notation of the available algorithms, it matches to the merge sort's one, that is, θ(n log n).

sort3 uses: Selection sort best 2.933 worst 3.175

How do you know?: Again, comparing the two scenarios, we get the upper bound being 3.175s and the lower bound being 2.933s. Examining the two running times, we observe that they are pretty close and are relatively fast, but not as fast as the algorithm of sort2. Therefore, it corresponds to the attributes of Selection sort, which is θ(n²).
