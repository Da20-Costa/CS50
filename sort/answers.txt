sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Using the best scenario (the list already sorted - 50000), it took 1.181s to sort it, which is pretty fast. However, in the worst scenario (the reversed list - 50000),it took 5.718s to sort it. Comparing the two running times, they correspond to the bounds of the bubble sort, which are quite distants from each other: O(n²) and Ω(n).

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Using the same method as before, when we compare the two running times (best: 1.583; worst: 1.193), they are quite similar, besides being pretty fast. Analising the asymptotic notation of the available algorithms, it matches to the merge sort's one, that is, θ(n log n).

sort3 uses: Selection sort best 2.933 worst 3.175

How do you know?: Again, comparing the two scenarios,
